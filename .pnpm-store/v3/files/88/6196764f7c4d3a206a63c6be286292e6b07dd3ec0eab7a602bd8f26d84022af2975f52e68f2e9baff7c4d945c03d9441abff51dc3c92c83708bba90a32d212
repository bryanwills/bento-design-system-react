# Publishing

## Latest build

When you are ready to publish a new version on npm (after updating the `CHANGLEOG.md` file ) run:

```bash
npm version [major | minor | patch]
npm publish
```

## Next build

Similar to the previous process:

```bash
npm version [premajor | preminor | prepatch | prerelease]
npm publish --tag next
```
