# Theming

Bento has been designed on top of a set of semantic design tokens which define the colors, typography and the general aspect of the Design System.
Each token corresponds to a CSS variable whose value can be changed at your will.

In the [quick start instructions](../intro#quick-start) we imported two different stylesheets for our default app:

- `index.css` contains the style for all the Bento components and it references the theme CSS variables. This file must always be imported in your app.
- `defaultTheme.css` defines a default theme for the library, i.e. it assigns a default value to each of those variables (this is the theme that is also used by the examples in the documentation).

You can customize the theme in two ways:

- (recommended) using Vanilla Extract
- using CSS variables directly

### Customizing the theme using Vanilla Extract

Bento is written using [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/), a CSS library which uses TypeScript to author styles.
Using the `createTheme` or `createGlobalTheme` functions, you have a type-safe way of implementing a theme. Since theme is typed, TypeScript can check that you did not forget or misspell any of the variables, and that's why we highly recommend this approach.

:::note
We will assume you already set-up Vanilla Extract for you project following [its official documentation](https://vanilla-extract.style/documentation/setup/).
:::

For example, here's how to define a theme:

```ts title="my-project/design-system/src/theme.css.ts"
import { createGlobalTheme } from "@vanilla-extract/css";
import { vars } from "@buildo/bento-design-system";

createGlobalTheme(":root", vars, {
  fontFamily: {
    default: "Arial",
  },
  // ...
});
```

:::tip
You may be wondering whether to use `createTheme` or `createGlobalTheme`.

The short answer is: use `createGlobalTheme` if your app has only one theme, use `createTheme` otherwise.

<summary>Discover more</summary>

`createGlobalTheme` will attach a set of variables to the given element (`:root` in the example above). This works fine if this the only theme of the application.

Suppose you have a light and a dark theme instead: in this scenario you want to selectively apply one theme or the other based on some logic.
Instead of directly attaching the variables to an element, `createTheme` gives you a class name instead, and it's your responsibility to apply it. For example:

```ts title="my-project/design-system/src/theme.css.ts"
import { createTheme } from "@vanilla-extract/css";
import { vars } from "@buildo/bento-design-system";

export const lightTheme = createTheme(vars, {
  /*...*/
});

export const darkTheme = createTheme(vars, {
  /*...*/
});
```

And then in your app:

```tsx title="my-project/app/src/components/App.tsx
import { lightTheme, darkTheme } from "design-system";
// Hypothetical utility for retrieving the user preferences
import { useUserPreferences } from "../utils/useUserPreferences";

export function App() {
  const { colorScheme } = useUserPreferences();
  return <div className={colorScheme === "dark" ? darkTheme : lightTheme}>Hello!</div>;
}
```

</details>

### Customizing the theme using plain CSS

As we discussed, Bento's theme is a collection of CSS variables, which you can override using CSS.

:::caution
This option is available but not recommended, as it's easy to forget or misspell a variable without any warning.
:::

You can either import the default theme and then override some of the default values using an additional stylesheet, or completely replace `defaultTheme.css` with your own stylesheet defining a value for each of the Bento variables.

```ts title="my-project/design-system/src/index.tsx"
import "@buildo/bento-design-system/lib/index.css";
import "./theme.css";
```

```css title="my-project/design-system/src/theme.css"
/* Import this file if you want to start from the defaultTheme and only override some variables */
@import "@buildo/bento-design-system/lib/defaultTheme.css";

:root {
  /* change the brand primary color */
  --bento-brandColor-brandPrimary: green;
  /* ... */
}
```

:::info
You can get a complete list of all the existing CSS variables by looking at the [default theme](https://github.com/buildo/bento-design-system/blob/main/packages/bento-design-system/src/defaultTheme.css.ts).
