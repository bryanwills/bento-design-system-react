# Customization

At this point, we got a set of components with a default configuration and theme.
However, Bento components are designed to be customized to your project's needs.
You can configure the Bento components in different ways:

- **theming:** assign different values to the design tokens Bento is based upon, to customize your DS foundations, like colors, typography, spacing, etc;
- **configuration:** Each component offers a variety of configurations you can set to change its basic aspect and behavior;
- **atoms augmentation:** add more design tokens and atomic CSS classes that will be used inside your project to define project-specific components.
