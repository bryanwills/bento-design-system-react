# Server-side rendering (SSR)

Bento uses [react-aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/) internally.
react-aria auto generates unique ids for some of Bento components.

Starting from version 0.20.0 you don't need to do anything to support consistent ids in an SSR setup, since recent versions of react-aria use the native React.useId() hook.

Note that this requires React >= 18, which is the version range supported by Bento.
