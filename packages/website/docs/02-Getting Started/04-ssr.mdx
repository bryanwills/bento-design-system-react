# Server-side rendering (SSR)

Bento uses [react-aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/) internally.
react-aria auto generates unique ids for some of Bento components.

To ensure the ids are consistent between the client and server in a SSR environment, you need to pass the `ssr` option to `BentoProvider`.

E.g.:

```tsx
<BentoProvider defaultMessages={defaultMessages} ssr>
  <YourSsrApp />
</BentoProvider>
```

This will wrap all components in react-aria's `SSRProvider`.
More info about SSR in react-aria [here](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/ssr.html).

Alternatively, Bento also exposes `SSRProvider` directly, in the rare in case in which you want to use it separately from `BentoProvider`.
