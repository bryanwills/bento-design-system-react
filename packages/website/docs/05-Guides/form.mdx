# Forms

Creating forms can be done using the `Form`, `FormSection` and `FormRow` components.

`Form` is a top-level container which renders a native `<form>` element and provides utilities for
displaying a title and description, as well as managing the space between `FormSection`.

`FormSection` helps in rendering sections of a form, which group together multiple form fields. It
can optionally render a title and description.

`FormRow` manages the horizontal layout of individual fields.

All these components are implemented in terms of the lower level layout components (namely `Stack`
and `Columns`) and can be freely mixed and matched to create complex layout as needed.

Let's see a basic example:

<Canvas path="Form/Basic" />

This form has a single section with two fields.

It's good practice use `FormSection` to group fields together - even in case of a single
section - in order to achieve consistent layouts.

Let's add a title and description to the form:

<Canvas path="Form/BasicWithTitleAndDescription" />

Forms are generally quite useless without a way of submitting them. The `Form` component provides a
way of rendering a standard submit button:

<Canvas path="Form/BasicWithSubmitButton" />

In case we need to, we can also add a secondary button next to the submit button:

<Canvas path="Form/BasicWithCancelButton" />

Let's add a few more sections to the form, this time adding some titles and descriptions:

<Canvas path="Form/MultipleSections" />

The form looks good, but in some cases we may want to customize the width of single fields. By
default, `FormRow` makes all fields in a row of the same width, filling the available space.

This can be customized by wrapping a field in a `Column` component. For example, let's make the
number take only 1/5 of the space, so that the street name has more room. Similarly, let's also make
the city and the country narrower, to better convey the expected length of such fields:

<Canvas path="Form/CustomFieldWidths" />

This API may look familiar and it's not by coincidence. The `FormRow` component is a thin wrapper
around the `Columns` layout component, which sets the default spacing between fields and the
collapse behavior (try resizing the window and you'll see form rows automatically collapse on small
screens).
