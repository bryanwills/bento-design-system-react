# Welcome to Bento Design System

Bento Design System is an extensible Design System for React.

Bento is configurable and extensible, and it's meant to be used as a foundation for your project's Design System.

## Quick start

The quickest way to start playing with `Bento` is by using the default configuration that is shipped with it.

Let's start by adding Bento to the project:

<PackageManagerCommand
  command={{
    pnpm: "add @buildo/bento-design-system",
    yarn: "add @buildo/bento-design-system",
    npm: "install @buildo/bento-design-system",
  }}
/>

Then, let's import the Bento stylesheet and the default theme from the project's index:

```ts
import "@buildo/bento-design-system/lib/index.css";
import "@buildo/bento-design-system/lib/defaultTheme.css";
```

Now we can create the Bento components and export them, so that we can import and use them whenever we need:

```ts
export const {
  TextField,
  Button,
  ...,
  DesignSystemProvider
} = createBentoComponents();
```

The `DesignSystemProvider`, returned along with the other components by `createBentoComponents`, provides a React context that is required for some components to work properly, so we need to wrap it around the project's root component.
When we do this, we must pass a `defaultMessages` object to it. This object contains a set of localized strings which are used by some components as default messages.

```tsx
import { defaultMessages } from "./defaultMessages";

<DesignSystemProvider defaultMessages={defaultMessages}>
  <App />
</DesignSystemProvider>;
```

## Customization

At this point, we got a set of components with a default configuration and theme.
However, Bento components are designed to be customized to your project's needs.
You can configure the Bento components in different ways:

- **theming:** Bento components are designed on top of a set of semantic design tokens, defining colors, spacings, typography, etc. These tokens consist in a set of CSS variables, which you can value as you wish to change the general look&feel of your app.
- **configuration:** Each component offers a variety of configurations you can set to change its basic anspect and behavior. You can both pass your configurations to `createBentoComponents`, or use component-specific constructors, like `createButtons`. By using component-specific constructors, you can also create different variants of the same component, to be used in different parts of your app.
- **atoms augmentation:** Bento has been built following the principles of [Atomic CSS](sprinkles-setup.md), and for this reason it defines a set of single-purpose CSS classes which, besides being used internally, can be used when building new project-specific components. In addition to this, Bento allows you to extend the set of atoms that are used to pre-generate these atomic classes, so that you can add even more design tokens and classes to meet your project's requirements. This process goes through the use of [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/), a type-safe CSS preprocessor that generates CSS classes from TypeScript files and that's been used internally to create all the Bento components.

## Setting up Vanilla Extract

Before moving forward, let's setup Vanilla Extract in your project, so that it can process your .css.ts files.

Vanilla Extract supports several popular bundlers, but for a design system package we recommend using [tsup](https://tsup.egoist.sh/), which is especially well-suited for TypeScript libraries.

Here's a possible setup using to get you started:

<PackageManagerCommand
  command={{
    pnpm: "add -D tsup @vanilla-extract/esbuild-plugin",
    yarn: "add -D tsup @vanilla-extract/esbuild-plugin",
    npm: "install -D tsup @vanilla-extract/esbuild-plugin",
  }}
/>

Create a file named `tsup.config.ts` in your project root:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "tsup";
import { vanillaExtractPlugin } from "@vanilla-extract/esbuild-plugin";

export default defineConfig({
  entry: ["src/index.ts"],
  outDir: "lib",
  esbuildPlugins: [vanillaExtractPlugin()],
  dts: true,
  // See https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#auto-import-for-jsx
  inject: ["./jsxShim.ts"],
});
```

And a file named `jsxShim.ts` in your project root:

```ts
// See https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#auto-import-for-jsx
import * as React from "react";
export { React };
```

Done! Now you can add two scripts to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "tsup --minify --clean",
  "watch": "tsup --watch",
}
```

Ok, now that we got the build stuff out of the way, let's continue with more interesting things!
